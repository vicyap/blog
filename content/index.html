<h1>The Mythical Mammoth</h1>

<sub>Perhaps you meant this: <a href="http://a.co/e8daoFu">The Mythical Man-Month</a></sub>

<p>I am about halfway through reading The Mythical Man Month. So far I am really surprised with how much software engineering has not changed since this book was first published (1975). I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had to work on a software project and deal with a team.</p>
